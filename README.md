## 🔧 Development

### 🛠️ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
````

### 🚀 Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 🔐 Git Hooks Setup

We use **Husky** with **Commitlint** to ensure all commits follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format.

To enable hooks after cloning the repo:

```bash
npm run prepare
```

This sets up Husky and activates `commit-msg` hooks.
